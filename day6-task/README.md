For Developers
1.Promotes cleaner code by separating normal logic from error-handling logic.
2.Encourages developers to think about failure scenarios and handle them explicitly.
3.Helps avoid unhandled exceptions that could bring down the entire system.
4.Supports fallback mechanisms (e.g., retrying, default values, alternative flows).
5.Systems can continue operating even when parts fail (e.g., network failures, file not found, user input errors)


For End Users / Operators
1.Instead of cryptic error messages (dont understand by user) or system crashes, users see friendly error prompts ("File not found", "Please check your internet connection").
2.Prevents loss or corruption of data by catching issues before critical operations (e.g., saving files, making transactions)
3.Users trust applications that behave predictably and donâ€™t fail without explanation.
